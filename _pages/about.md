My name is **Yuhui Hao (郝宇辉)**. I am currently pursuing my PhD at the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/), and I am affiliated with the [Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ict.cas.cn/). I am now working towards my PhD under the supervision of Assistant Professor [Yiming Gan](https://yiminggan.com/) and Professor [Yinhe Han](http://www.ict.ac.cn/sourcedb/cn/jssrck/201610/t20161010_4674169.html). 

Before this, I completed my Bachelor and Master degrees at the [School of Microelectronics](https://sme.tju.edu.cn/), [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/), under the guidance of Professor [Qiang Liu](https://faculty.tju.edu.cn/116022/zh_CN/index.htm).
