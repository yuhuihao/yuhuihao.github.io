My name is Yuhui Hao (郝宇辉). I am currently pursuing my PhD at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), where I am affiliated with the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT) as a PhD candidate. Before this, I completed my undergraduate and master's degrees at the School of Microelectronics, Tianjin University (TJU), under the guidance of Professor Qiang Liu. I am now working towards my PhD under the supervision of Assistant Professor Yiming Gan and Professor Yinhe Han.
